      {question: "A system administrator is troubleshooting a server that fails to start. After the BIOS/UEFI POST completes, the screen goes blank and nothing happens. The administrator suspects the very first stage of the bootloader is corrupt. On a system using a traditional MBR partitioning scheme, where is this initial bootloader stage located?", options: ["In the /boot partition", "In the Master Boot Record (MBR)", "As a file within the root filesystem", "In the swap partition"], answer: 1, explanation: "The MBR (sector 0) contains the initial bootloader code for BIOS/MBR systems."},
      {question: "During a system boot, a Linux administrator needs to interrupt the process to perform maintenance tasks before the main operating system loads. Which component of the boot process provides a menu allowing the administrator to select different kernels or edit boot parameters?", options: ["The systemd init process", "The BIOS/UEFI firmware", "The GRUB 2 bootloader", "The initramfs image"], answer: 2, explanation: "GRUB 2 offers an interactive menu for kernel selection and parameter editing during boot."},

Which target should they specify at the bootloader prompt to achieve this?", options: ["emergency.target", "graphical.target", "rescue.target", "multi-user.target"], answer: 2, explanation: "rescue.target provides single-user mode (runlevel 1) for root shell access."},
      {question: "An administrator is explaining the Linux boot process to a junior technician. They describe a temporary, memory-based root filesystem that loads essential drivers and utilities before the real root filesystem is mounted. What is this temporary filesystem called?", options: ["The GRUB filesystem", "The swap space", "The initramfs (initial RAM filesystem)", "The /temp directory"], answer: 2, explanation: "initramfs is a cpio archive loaded into RAM for early boot modules and mounting the real root."},
      {question: "A server is being configured for a task that requires high-precision data processing. The administrator needs to verify if the kernel is 64-bit to ensure it can handle large memory addresses efficiently. Which command's output would confirm a 64-bit architecture?", options: ["uname -m showing x86_64", "uname -o showing GNU/Linux", "uname -v showing a version number", "uname -n showing the hostname"], answer: 0, explanation: "uname -m returns x86_64 for 64-bit systems."},
