Some practical techniques for managing servers and resolving hardware issues. Below are two key lessons for future reference.

## 1. Using SCP for Secure File Transfers

The `scp` command is a powerful tool for securely transferring files from a remote server to a local machine. For example, to copy all `.txt` files from a server’s `/root/` directory to a local Windows machine, I use:

```bash
scp root@serveraddress:/root/*.txt C:\Users\location_where_I_want_to_save_files
```

**Key Points**:

- Replace `serveraddress` with the server’s IP or hostname (e.g., `192.168.65.5`).
- Ensure SSH access is configured (e.g., `openssh-server` installed on the server).
- The destination path (`C:\Users\...`) works when running `scp` from a Windows command prompt or PowerShell with an SSH client installed.

This method is efficient for retrieving logs or configuration files securely.

## 2. Clearing CMOS to Resolve Boot Issues

When a unit fails to boot despite exhaustive troubleshooting (e.g., checking GRUB, kernel logs, or filesystem errors), clearing the CMOS can resolve hardware-related issues. The process involves:

1. Power off the unit and remove the battery.
2. Wait for 5 minutes to ensure the CMOS memory is cleared.
3. Reinsert the battery and power on the unit.

**Key Points**:

- Clearing the CMOS resets BIOS/UEFI settings to defaults, which can fix boot issues caused by corrupted firmware settings.
- Always document any custom BIOS settings (e.g., boot order) before clearing.
- This technique is particularly useful for data center hardware troubleshooting.

These lessons have been critical in my role, enhancing my efficiency in server management and hardware diagnostics.
