# My Learning Journey

Hi! I'm documenting my progress in studying for the **CompTIA Linux+** certification and other tech-related skills from work and self-study. This site, built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, will include notes, reflections, and projects.

## About This Site

- **Purpose**: Track my learning, especially Linux+ topics like system administration and troubleshooting.
- **Content**: Blog posts, code snippets, and study summaries.
- **Focus**: Practical Linux skills, like understanding the initramfs stage in the boot process.
